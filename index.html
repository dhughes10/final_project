 	<h3>Album Cover Creator</h3></center>
 	<h3>I intend to create a tool for artists or musicians who want to easily develop album covers. This page would allow users to upload images and distort them using different features. When the images are uploaded the original image size will be cropped to the proper size for an album cover. Users will be given the option to add filters to their images. They will have the option to draw on top of the image using a paint tool. Adding text to the image is another option the user can take by typing in the ablum/band/artist name in a field. This album cover creator will have a clear and save button. The clear button will delete and reset the page. By hitting the save button the user will recieve a download of their creation. </h3>
